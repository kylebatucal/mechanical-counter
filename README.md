# Mechanical Counter

Skeuomorph of a mechanical counter implemented in React. I tried to emulate a real mechanical counter as close as possible. I created this because I thought it would be a nice beginner project.

## Features

- Left click to increment the counter.
- Scroll up to reset the counter (just like a real mechanical counter).
- Set the counter to a custom number using query parameters (e.g. `?count=1234`).
- Smooth CSS animations using 3D transforms.
- Responsive design.

## TODO:

- Sound effects
- Light and dark mode
- Persistence
